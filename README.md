The Force.com PHP Toolkit provides an easy-to-use wrapper for the Force.com Web Services SOAP API, presenting SOAP client implementations for both the enterprise and partner WSDLs.

See the [getting started guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/PHP_Toolkit_13.0_Getting_Started) for sample code to create, retrieve, update and delete records in the Force.com database.
